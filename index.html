  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Long Walk Games was founded in May 2025 by Siri and Sean, two longtime friends and collaborators based in Galway, Ireland. The name is inspired by Galway’s iconic Long Walk and the journey we've taken (and still have ahead) to grow into the game developers we aspire to be.
  </p>
  <p>
Our first project is called <b>Book Nook</b>. Book Nook is a cosy management and life sim where you nurture a forgotten public library through daily care and upgrades, quietly learning about the patrons through the books they check out and the items they leave behind.  </p>

  <h2>Learning in Public</h2>
  <p>
    Long Walk Games is just getting started — and this site is where we document the journey. We're learning game development one step at a time, from prototyping in Godot to publishing our work on the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    No demos yet, but we'll sharing our progress as we go. Expect experiments, lessons learned, and eventually, playable builds.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re curious, kind, or just like cozy games, we’d love to have you following along.

  <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
    Created by following a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrantAbbitt" target="_blank">Grant Abbitt</a> tutorial. This was a practice piece Siri made to build skills in basic modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering.
