  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>
    Long Walk Games was founded in May 2025 by Siri and Sean, two longtime friends and collaborators based in Galway, Ireland. The name is inspired by Galway’s iconic Long Walk — a nod both to the place we've made our home, and the journey we've taken (and still have ahead) to grow into the game developers we aspire to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    We met while working on a small team at a big tech company, where conversations about books and games were a daily escape. Over time, our casual daydreams of "making a game someday" turned into something more serious. Even after parting ways professionally, we kept in touch — and eventually, over a pint on a rare sunny day in Galway, we realized we were both independently building up our game dev skills. That chat turned into a plan.
  </p>
  <p>
Our first project is called <b>Book Nook</b>. Book Nook is a cosy management and life sim where you nurture a forgotten public library through daily care and upgrades, quietly learning about the patrons through the books they check out and the items they leave behind.  </p>
  <p>
    We don’t have a motto, but we believe in getting better one day at a time. We aim to measure our progress not by comparing ourselves to others, but by looking back at who we were last week.
